## Alternatives Explored and Decisions Made

### 1. **macOS APIs for UI and Control**
   - **Question**: What APIs support a minimal UI with hotkey/voice control?
   - **Alternatives**:
     - **Cocoa and Carbon APIs**: Suitable for building a minimal UI.
     - **Speech Framework**: Native macOS support for voice commands.
     - **Accessibility API**: Enables system-level control, including window movement [Apple Accessibility API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/accessibility).
   - **Decision**: Use the Accessibility API for window control and Speech Framework for voice commands, as they are native and align with power-user needs for speed and minimal UI.
   - **Reasoning**: Accessibility API allows robust window manipulation without SIP changes, and Speech Framework supports voice-driven commands, reducing UI dependency.

### 2. **Window Movement Across Workspaces**
   - **Question**: Can windows be moved across workspaces with SIP enabled?
   - **Alternatives**:
     - **Accessibility API**: Can move windows if user grants permission in System Preferences.
     - **Disabling SIP**: Allows deeper system control but compromises security.
   - **Decision**: Use Accessibility API with user permission to move windows across workspaces.
   - **Reasoning**: SIP must remain enabled for security, and Accessibility API supports workspace transitions (e.g., as seen in Mission Control), making it sufficient with proper user configuration [Apple System Integrity Protection](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204899).

### 3. **Searching Windows and Tabs**
   - **Question**: How to find specific windows or tabs in apps like Firefox or terminal emulators?
   - **Alternatives**:
     - **Accessibility API**: Query window titles and tab labels, though app-specific support varies.
     - **App-Specific APIs**: Directly interface with apps like Firefox, but requires custom integration.
   - **Decision**: Use Accessibility API to query window and tab information across apps.
   - **Reasoning**: Accessibility API provides a unified approach to access window and tab data, avoiding the need for app-specific APIs, which may not be universally available.

### 4. **Plugin Structure for App Integration**
   - **Question**: What’s a good plugin structure for incremental app support?
   - **Alternatives**:
     - **Binary Plugins (Factory Pattern)**: Dynamically load plugins at runtime using a factory pattern.
     - **Script-Based Plugins (JavaScript/Lua)**: Use scripts to avoid binary dependency issues.
     - **JavaScriptCore**: Native macOS JavaScript engine for script-based plugins [Apple JavaScriptCore](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/javascriptcore).
   - **Decision**: Use JavaScriptCore with JavaScript-based plugins for app adapters.
   - **Reasoning**: Binary plugins risk ABI and versioning issues, as you noted from past experience. JavaScriptCore is native, lightweight, and avoids these problems by using scripts, which can be updated easily for new app versions.

### 5. **AI for Contextual Window Management**
   - **Question**: How can AI suggest or automate window navigation based on user history?
   - **Alternatives**:
     - **Core ML**: For traditional ML to analyze usage patterns [Apple Core ML](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreml).
     - **LLM**: For natural language processing of voice commands or queries.
   - **Decision**: Use Core ML for usage pattern analysis and optionally an LLM for voice-driven navigation.
   - **Reasoning**: Core ML excels at pattern recognition (e.g., predicting workspace relevance), while an LLM could enhance voice command flexibility. Core ML is prioritized for its native integration and efficiency in handling structured data like window usage.

### 6. **Gathering Context for Navigation**
   - **Question**: How to gather context, especially from actions like Google searches?
   - **Alternatives**:
     - **Accessibility API**: Parse browser search text or active app data.
     - **File/Content Analysis**: Scan project files or window contents for context.
   - **Decision**: Use Accessibility API to parse browser search text and match it to project windows via Core ML.
   - **Reasoning**: Accessibility API can directly access search queries or window titles, enabling precise matching (e.g., “React error” to a React project workspace). File analysis is slower and less immediate.

### 7. **Window Categorization and Hotkey Mapping**
   - **Question**: Can windows be categorized and mapped to hotkeys for navigation?
   - **Alternatives**:
     - **Manual Categorization**: User-defined categories and hotkeys.
     - **Automatic Categorization**: Use window titles and app types for automatic grouping.
   - **Decision**: Implement automatic categorization (e.g., code, browsers, PDFs) with hotkey mappings, using Accessibility API and Core ML.
   - **Reasoning**: Automatic categorization reduces user effort, and Core ML can refine categories based on usage, making hotkey navigation (e.g., command-1 for code) intuitive and fast.

### 8. **Narrowing Context to Specific Screen Regions**
   - **Question**: How to focus context on highlighted text or specific screen areas?
   - **Alternatives**:
     - **Cursor/Highlight Method**: Use Accessibility API to grab selected text or cursor position.
     - **Screenshot Method**: Capture a rectangular region and parse text/image with vision APIs.
   - **Decision**: Use cursor/highlight method for context analysis.
   - **Reasoning**: Highlighting is faster (near-instantaneous) compared to screenshot parsing (10-20ms due to OCR), critical for power-user speed. Accessibility API directly accesses text, avoiding image processing overhead.

### 9. **Performance Comparison of Context Methods**
   - **Question**: Which is faster: cursor-based or screenshot-based context analysis?
   - **Alternatives**:
     - **Cursor/Highlight**: Directly accesses text, nearly instantaneous.
     - **Screenshot/OCR**: Captures region, parses text, adds 10-20ms delay.
   - **Decision**: Prioritize cursor/highlight method for speed.
   - **Reasoning**: The 10-20ms delay in OCR is noticeable for frequent hotkey use, as you highlighted. Cursor-based access is more efficient and aligns with power-user needs for minimal latency.

### 10. **Intuitive Window Layout**
    - **Question**: How to lay out windows intuitively for power users?
    - **Alternatives**:
      - **Grid-Based Snapping**: Assign windows to screen quadrants with hotkeys/voice.
      - **Manual Layout**: User-defined window positions.
    - **Decision**: Implement grid-based snapping with hotkey/voice support, enhanced by Core ML suggestions.
    - **Reasoning**: Grid-based snapping is fast and intuitive, especially for power users, and Core ML can learn preferred layouts, reducing manual configuration.

## Final Architecture

  - **Accessibility API**: For window movement, tab searching, and context gathering (e.g., selected text, browser searches).
  - **JavaScriptCore**: For script-based plugins to interface with apps like Firefox or terminal emulators.
  - **Core ML**: To analyze user patterns and suggest workspace or window navigation.
  - **Speech Framework**: For optional voice command support.
- **Features**:
  - Automatic window categorization (e.g., code, browsers) with hotkey mappings (e.g., command-1 for code).
  - Contextual navigation using highlighted text or cursor position, triggered by hotkeys (e.g., command-shift-C).
  - Grid-based window snapping for intuitive layouts, with Core ML suggesting optimal arrangements.
- **Pain Points Addressed**:
  - **Workspace Confusion**: Categorization and context-aware hotkeys reduce time spent finding windows.
  - **Terminal Tab Overload**: Searchable tabs via Accessibility API and LLM-enhanced natural language queries.
- **Performance Optimization**: Prioritize cursor/highlight for context to ensure sub-10ms response times, critical for power users.

## Conclusion
The architecture leverages native macOS APIs (Accessibility, JavaScriptCore, Core ML, Speech) to create a fast, minimal-UI app that addresses your pain points. The cursor-based context method and script-based plugins ensure speed and flexibility, while Core ML provides intelligent navigation. This design balances power-user efficiency with extensibility for future app support.
