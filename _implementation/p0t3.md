# Phase 0, Task 3: Communication Bridge

This document logs the implementation and debugging process for creating the communication bridge between the Swift front-end and the Python back-end.

## 1. Initial Implementation

The initial goal was to establish a basic client-server connection.

- **Python Server:** A FastAPI server was created in `python/main.py` with a single `/command` endpoint. A helper script, `python/run_server.sh`, was created to manage the virtual environment and launch the server.
- **Swift Client:** A network client class, `AgentClient`, was created in `JamSession3/AgentClient.swift`. It included `Codable` structs for requests/responses and a function to send commands.
- **UI Integration:** The template `ContentView.swift` was cleared of boilerplate and updated with a simple UI to send hardcoded "record" and "stop" commands to the Python server.

## 2. Debugging the Python Server

- **Issue:** When running `./python/run_server.sh`, the server failed to start with the error: `ERROR: Error loading ASGI app. Could not import module "main"`.
- **Root Cause:** The `uvicorn` command was being executed from the project root, but the `main.py` module was located in the `python/` subdirectory, causing a path issue.
- **Resolution:** The `run_server.sh` script was updated to change its current directory to the script's own directory (`python/`) before launching `uvicorn`. This ensured the `main` module was in the correct path.

## 3. Debugging the Swift Client

- **Issue:** When sending a command from the macOS app, Xcode produced a console error: `nw_socket_connect ... failed: [1: Operation not permitted]`.
- **Root Cause:** The macOS App Sandbox was preventing the application from making outgoing network calls, which is a default security behavior.
- **Resolution:** The project's entitlements were updated. The key `com.apple.security.network.client` was added and set to `true` in the `JamSession3/JamSession3.entitlements` file, explicitly granting the app permission to act as a network client.

## Outcome

After these fixes, the communication bridge was successfully established. The Swift app can now send commands to the Python server and receive responses.
