# Phase 4: Packaging, Project Management, and Final Polish

**Goal:** Transform the prototype into a distributable macOS application with robust project management features.

This phase focuses on three key areas:
1.  **Packaging:** Bundling the Python backend into a single executable and integrating it into the main Swift application.
2.  **Project Management:** Implementing a complete "New, Open, Save, Save As" workflow using a `.jamproject` bundle.
3.  **Finalization:** Adding comprehensive error handling and logging.

### **Preliminary Task: Implement Tempo Control & Scheduled Recording**

**Objective:** Refactor the recording workflow to be handled entirely on the native Swift client. This will eliminate network latency from the timing-critical recording action and ensure all loops are perfectly synchronized.

**Rationale:** The current implementation sends a "record" command to the Python backend, which introduces unacceptable latency for a musical action. By making this a purely native function, we provide the instant response necessary for a seamless user experience.

**Steps:**

1.  **State Management & UI Controls (`AppState.swift` & `ContentView.swift`):**
    *   **Tempo Control:**
        *   Add a new `@Published` property `sessionBPM: Double = 120.0` to `AppState.swift`. This will serve as the single source of truth for the project's tempo.
        *   In `ContentView.swift`, add a `Stepper` or `TextField` bound to the new `sessionBPM` property to allow direct user manipulation.
    *   **Loop Duration Control:**
        *   Add a UI element (e.g., a `Picker` or segmented `Control`) to allow the user to select the desired loop length (e.g., 2, 4, 8 measures).
        *   This selection must be bound to a new `@Published` property in `AppState.swift` (e.g., `loopDurationInMeasures: Int`).
    *   The "Record" button's action should no longer trigger a call to the `AgentClient`. It must now directly call a new, dedicated function in the `AudioManager`, such as `startScheduledRecording()`.

2.  **Audio Engine Refactor (`AudioManager.swift`):**
    *   **Create `startScheduledRecording()` function:** This will be the new entry point for recording. It will replace the direct calls to `startRecording()` and `stopRecordingAndCreateLoop()`.
    *   **Pre-Roll Logic:**
        *   When called, the function will *not* record immediately. It will read the `sessionBPM` from `AppState` to determine the project's tempo and calculate the duration of a single measure.
        *   It will then continue playing existing audio for one full measure to serve as a "pre-roll" or "count-in," allowing the user to get into the rhythm.
    *   **Automatic Punch-In/Out:**
        *   Using both the `sessionBPM` and `loopDurationInMeasures` from `AppState`, the function will calculate the exact sample-accurate length of the desired loop.
        *   It will use `AVAudioEngine`'s precise scheduling methods to **automatically start** the recording on the downbeat after the pre-roll measure and **automatically stop** it after the selected loop duration has elapsed.
        *   This completely removes the need for the user to press a "stop" button, guaranteeing perfect loops. The existing `startRecording()` and `stopRecordingAndCreateLoop()` methods will be refactored and made `private`, as they will now be internal tools for the new scheduled recording logic.

3.  **Decouple Backend Communication:**
    *   The `AudioManager` will now be responsible for notifying the backend *after* a loop has been successfully recorded.
    *   Upon the successful, automatic completion of a recording, `AudioManager` will call a method in `AgentClient` (e.g., `notifyLoopCreated(at: URL, with trackID: String)`).
    *   This `AgentClient` method will then send a new command to the Python agent (e.g., `{"action": "new_loop_created", "path": "relative/path/to/audio.wav", "track_id": "..."}`) so the agent can update its state accordingly.

4.  **Python Agent Update (`main.py`):**
    *   **Tempo Commands:** Enhance the agent's router to understand voice commands like "Set tempo to 90 BPM" or "Make it a bit faster." This should trigger an action that updates the `sessionBPM` in `AppState` via the API.
    *   **New Loop Handling:** The agent's router node must be updated to handle the `new_loop_created` action. It will simply add the new track to its state object and associate it with the current project tempo.

### **Task 1: Packaging the Python Backend with PyInstaller**

**Objective:** Create a self-contained executable for the Python backend to simplify distribution. The Python virtual environment is located at `python/jamsession3`.

**Steps:**

1.  **Install PyInstaller:**
    *   Activate the virtual environment: `source python/jamsession3/bin/activate`
    *   Install PyInstaller: `pip install pyinstaller`

2.  **Create a Build Script:**
    *   Create a `build.sh` script inside the `python/` directory.
    *   This script will run PyInstaller with the necessary options.
    *   **Command:**
        ```bash
        pyinstaller main.py \
        --name JamSessionAgent \
        --onefile \
        --noconsole \
        --add-data "path/to/langgraph/models:models" \
        --hidden-import="langchain_community" \
        # Add any other necessary hidden imports or data files
        ```
    *   The `--noconsole` flag is crucial for a background process on macOS.

3.  **Test the Executable:**
    *   Run the generated executable from the `dist/` folder independently to ensure it starts without errors.
    *   Use `curl` to send a test command to the running agent to verify it's functional.

---

### **Task 2: Application Integration**

**Objective:** Seamlessly launch and terminate the Python backend from the main Swift application.

**Steps:**

1.  **Bundle the Executable (Xcode Build Phase):**
    *   In Xcode, go to the "Build Phases" tab for the main application target.
    *   Add a new "Copy Files" phase.
    *   Set the "Destination" to "Executables".
    *   Add the `JamSessionAgent` executable generated by PyInstaller to this phase. This will ensure the agent is copied into the `YourApp.app/Contents/MacOS/` directory.

2.  **Process Management in Swift (`AppState.swift`):**
    *   Create a new class, `AgentProcessManager`, to handle the lifecycle of the Python process.
    *   **`startAgent()` method:**
        *   Get the path to the bundled executable using `Bundle.main.path(forResource: "JamSessionAgent", ofType: nil)`.
        *   Create a `Process` object.
        *   Set its `executableURL`.
        *   Launch the process using `try process.run()`.
        *   Store the `Process` object in a property to manage it.
    *   **`stopAgent()` method:**
        *   Call `process.terminate()` on the stored process object.

3.  **Lifecycle Integration (`JamSession3App.swift`):**
    *   In the main `App` struct, instantiate `AgentProcessManager`.
    *   On application launch (`.onAppear` or similar), call `agentProcessManager.startAgent()`.
    *   On application quit (`.onDisappear` or `NSApplicationDelegate`), call `agentProcessManager.stopAgent()`.

### **Task 3: Project Management (Open/Save)**

**Objective:** Implement a full file management system for creating, saving, and loading projects.

#### **Sub-task 3.1: Defining the Project Bundle (`.jamproject`)**

*   A `.jamproject` file is a directory.
*   **Structure:**
    ```
    MyCoolSong.jamproject/
    ├── project.sqlite  # The history database for this project
    └── audio/          # Directory for all associated audio loops
        ├── loop1.wav
        └── loop2.wav
    ```

#### **Sub-task 3.2: Backend Modifications (Python)**

1.  **Update `HistoryManager`:**
    *   Modify the `HistoryManager.__init__` method to accept a `db_path` argument.
    *   All SQLite connections should now point to this `db_path`.
    *   Example: `self.conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)`

2.  **Update Agent State:**
    *   The agent must be launched with the root path of the active `.jamproject` bundle.
    *   All file paths within the agent's state (e.g., paths to audio files) **must** be stored as relative paths from the project root (e.g., `audio/loop1.wav`).

3.  **Modify FastAPI Endpoint:**
    *   The Swift app will need to inform the agent which project to work on. This could be done via a special `/set_project` endpoint that is called once after opening a project, or by passing the project path as a command-line argument when launching the agent. The command-line argument approach is more robust.
    *   Modify the agent startup logic in `main.py` to accept a `--project-path` argument.

#### **Sub-task 3.3: Frontend UI and Logic (SwiftUI)**

1.  **File Menu Commands:**
    *   In `JamSession3App.swift`, add a `Commands` scene modifier to build the "File" menu.
    ```swift
    // In JamSession3App.swift
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
        }
        .commands {
            FileMenuCommands() // Custom command set
        }
    }
    
    // New file: FileMenuCommands.swift
    struct FileMenuCommands: Commands {
        var body: some Commands {
            CommandGroup(replacing: .newItem) {
                Button("New") { /* Call AppState.newProject() */ }
                    .keyboardShortcut("n", modifiers: .command)
                Button("Open...") { /* Call AppState.openProject() */ }
                    .keyboardShortcut("o", modifiers: .command)
                // ... Save, Save As ...
            }
        }
    }
    ```

2.  **`AppState` / `ProjectManager` Logic (Swift):**
    *   Create a `ProjectManager` class to handle file operations.
    *   **`newProject()`:**
        *   Present an `NSSavePanel` to ask the user where to save the new project.
        *   On success, create a new directory with the `.jamproject` extension.
        *   Inside, create the `audio/` subdirectory.
        *   Tell the agent to initialize a new, empty `project.sqlite` at that location.
    *   **`openProject()`:**
        *   Present an `NSOpenPanel` configured to select `.jamproject` directories.
        *   On success, terminate the current agent process.
        *   Launch a new agent process, passing the selected project path as a command-line argument.
    *   **`saveProject()` / `saveProjectAs()`:**
        *   If the project is new or "Save As" is used, show an `NSSavePanel`.
        *   Copy the entire existing project bundle to the new location.
        *   Update the active project path in the app state.

---

### **Task 4: Finalization**

**Objective:** Add robust error handling and logging to make the application production-ready.

**Steps:**

1.  **Error Handling (Swift):**
    *   Wrap all process management and file I/O operations in `do-catch` blocks.
    *   Display user-friendly alerts (`Alert`) for common errors (e.g., "Could not open project," "Agent process failed to start").

2.  **Error Handling (Python):**
    *   Implement `try-except` blocks around critical operations, especially API calls in `MusicGenerationNode` and state modifications.
    *   Return structured error messages to the Swift app (e.g., `{"error": "Music generation failed."}`). The Swift app should then present this to the user.

3.  **Logging:**
    *   **Python:** Use the standard `logging` library to write logs to a file (e.g., `~/.JamSession/agent.log`). This will be invaluable for debugging issues on users' machines.
    *   **Swift:** Use Apple's unified `Logger` framework to log application lifecycle events and errors.

---

### **Testing & Verification for Phase 4**

1.  **Packaging:** Archive the app in Xcode and install the `.app` on a clean macOS machine. Verify it launches and the agent runs automatically.
2.  **Functionality:** Test all features from Phases 1-3.
3.  **Project Management:**
    *   Create a new project. Record a loop. Save it.
    *   Close the app.
    *   Re-launch the app and open the saved project. Verify the loop is present and plays correctly.
    *   Use "Save As" to duplicate the project. Verify a new, independent `.jamproject` bundle is created.
4.  **Error States:** Intentionally cause errors (e.g., disconnect from the internet to make music generation fail) and verify that user-friendly error messages are displayed.
